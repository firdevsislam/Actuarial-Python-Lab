# 📊 Actuarial Python Lab

**"Where Actuarial Science meets Software Engineering."**

This repository serves as a digital laboratory where I implement actuarial formulas, statistical models, and risk calculations using Python. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical actuarial exams and real-world software applications.

## 🚀 Project Goals
- **Automate** standard actuarial calculations (Expected Loss, Premium Calculation, etc.).
- **Simulate** insurance risk scenarios using Python libraries.
- **Document** my journey of becoming an Actuary with a Software Engineering background.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (Coming soon)
- **Focus:** Insurance Analytics, Risk Modeling, InsurTech
